## **Installation**

### **Backend Setup**

**Clone the Repository & Navigate to the Backend Folder:**  
git clone https://github.com/shubhamprasad318/event-management.git  

1. cd event-management/event-management-backend   
2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   npm install

**Create a `.env` File:**  
MONGO\_URI=your\_mongodb\_connection\_string    
JWT\_SECRET=your\_jwt\_secret\_key  

3. PORT=5000   
4. **Start the Backend Server:**  
   node server.js

### **Frontend Setup**

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Folder:**  
   cd ../event-frontend  
2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   npm install   
3. **Start the Development Server:**  
   npm run dev   
    The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## **Configuration**

* **Environment Variables (Backend):**  
  Ensure you set your MongoDB connection string and JWT secret in the `.env` file.  
* **API URL (Frontend):**  
  The frontend is configured to use `http://localhost:5000` by default. Update this as necessary for production.

---

## **Usage**

1. **User Authentication:**  
   * Register a new account or log in with existing credentials.  
   * (*Optional*) Use a guest login for limited features if implemented.  
2. **Event Dashboard:**  
   * View all events on the dashboard.  
   * Filter events using the search bar, upcoming/past buttons, and location filters.  
   * Click "Home" to return to the default event list.  
3. **Event Management:**  
   * Create new events by filling out the event form (includes fields for name, description, date/time, and location).  
   * Edit or delete events you created.  
   * Simulate attendee updates in real time using the "+1 Attendee" button.  
   * Join event rooms to receive real-time updates.

---

## **API Endpoints**

### **Authentication**

* **POST** `/api/auth/register`  
  Register a new user.  
* **POST** `/api/auth/login`  
  Log in an existing user and return a JWT token.

### **Events**

* **POST** `/api/events`  
  Create a new event. *(Requires authentication)*  
* **GET** `/api/events`  
  Retrieve all events.  
* **GET** `/api/events/upcoming`  
  Retrieve events scheduled for the future.  
* **GET** `/api/events/past`  
  Retrieve events that have already occurred.  
* **GET** `/api/events/search?query=...`  
  Search events by name, description, and location.  
* **PUT** `/api/events/:id`  
  Update an event (only accessible by the creator).  
* **DELETE** `/api/events/:id`  
  Delete an event (only accessible by the creator).

### **Real-Time Updates**

* **Socket.IO:**  
  Clients emit `attendeeUpdate` to increment an eventâ€™s attendee count. The server broadcasts the updated event via the `attendeeUpdated` event.

---

## **Deployment**

* **Frontend:**  
  Deploy the Next.js application on Vercel or Netlify.  
* **Backend:**  
  Deploy the Node.js/Express API on Render or Railway.app.  
* **Database:**  
  Use MongoDB Atlas for a free database solution.

---

## **Additional Notes**

* **Modular Design:**  
  The codebase is organized with separate folders for the frontend and backend. Each component (authentication, event management, real-time updates, etc.) is modular for easy maintenance and scalability.  
* **Future Enhancements:**  
  Additional features such as advanced location filtering (with maps integration), image uploads, and guest login functionality can be added with minimal changes.  
* **Free Hosting & Tools:**  
  This project leverages free-tier hosting services (Vercel, Render, MongoDB Atlas) and open-source libraries, making it an affordable solution for event management.
